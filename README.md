🌟 Power BI Dashboard: Indian Election Analysis (2019 &amp; 2014) 🌟 

I'm excited to share this detailed dashboard I created with Power BI and Figma, showcasing the major results of the Indian General Elections in 2019 and 2014.

✨ Highlights:

🏆 BJP: Boosted their seat count from 282 in 2014 to 303 in 2019.

📉 INC: Slightly improved from 44 seats in 2014 to 52 in 2019.

📊 Voter Turnout: Increased significantly, with total votes rising from 554 million in 2014 to 614 million in 2019.

This visualization not only compares the seat distribution but also delves into voting margins and party performance, providing a clear picture of the electoral trends.

I’m eager to hear your feedback and thoughts on this data-driven analysis!
